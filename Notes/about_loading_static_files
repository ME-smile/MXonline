    when running the project, I tried to login in.Although it successed,it performed weiredly.It seemed that all the 
static files were not found.I was so confused...
    the here are the code:
    ①views.login
      def login(request):
      if request.method == 'POST':
          user = auth.authenticate(request,username=request.POST.get('username',''),password=request.POST.get('password',''))
          if user is not None:
              auth.login(request,user)
              return render(request,'index.html',{})
              # return redirect('index')
          else:
              return render(request,'login.html')     
      elif request.method == 'GET':
          return render(request,'login.html')

      ②views.index
      def index(request):
          return render(request,'index.html')
  

when I tried to access,it performed well,all the styles and images were displayed,as well as the js.
when I logged in,all of above didn't work.aha???
then , I started analysing and found out the key.
It went wrong because the path was not correct.
when I tried to access the index directly ,the path was '/',
but when I logged in and then accessed to the index ,the path was '/login/'.
